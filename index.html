	<p>For my thesis I want to research the use of ‘low culture’ like pop music, action movies and genre literature for communication that goes beyond the type of communication usually tied to this kind of culture. 

In postmodernity, value judgements of ’fake’ and ‘real’ are no longer meaningful in the same way they used to be. I believe this has not just led to a lack of overall sincerity or realness, which is what postmodernism is often maligned for, but also to intense profoundness as a subversive, transgressive element in media where it is not usually part of the communicative code (this strategy of subversion in pop media is something the Situationists named Détournement). Since graphic design is often in the space of low culture, I think it is very relevant for a designer to look into this mode of communication.

I want to find a way of classifying and defining this phenomenon. In essence, I want to come to a more general understanding of this thing I recognise in different works of art and entertainment but for which I haven’t yet found a proper definition. 

I want to find out more about this by looking at postmodern theory. I think the Situationists provide a good starting point because they have (the beginning of) a definition down for this rather loose idea. At the same time I want to look at what I think are examples of what I am talking about and see if I can draw comparisons between works, in order to get closer to a definition myself. </p>
